# Black Swan API

A simple Go-implemented API for the [blackswan](https://github.com/brandur/blackswan) project. Implemented as an experiment to compare the speed of Go to that of an equivalent Ruby project.

```
# depends on blackswan db being available
go get
export $(cat .env)
./blackswan-api
```
